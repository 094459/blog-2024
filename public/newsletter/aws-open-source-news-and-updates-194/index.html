    <h1>AWS open source newsletter #194</h1>
    <h2 id="edition-194">Edition #194</h2>
<p>Welcome to issue #194 of the AWS open source newsletter, the newsletter where we try and provide you the best open source on AWS content. Due to travelling and speaking commitments, regular readers will have noticed that I slipped up and missed a week. Normal service has been resumed, and as always, this week we start with a round up of some freshly baked new projects for you to practice your four freedoms. This week we have projects that simplify working with your AWS credentials, provide an automated way of receiving guidance to troubleshoot deployment issues, tools to help you assess the right foundational models to use, a take on the timeless top utility, but applied to data analytics workloads, as well as a number of really cool demo projects, the pick of which for me is the one that helps you get lots of information from videos, without having to watch them.  Also featured this week is content covering open source technologies that include AWS CDK, Kubernetes, Apache Kafka, Prometheus, ArgoCD, Kyverno, Karpenter, Bottlerocket, Konveyor, PostgreSQL, OpenSearch,  AWS ParallelCluster, AWS Amplify, Next.js, Apache Flink, MySQL, Amazon Corretto, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, AlmaLinux,  Amazon Linux, Cedar, and InfluxDB.</p>
<p>I am actually at the start of a four week trip in Asia, kicking things off in Singapore where I will be meeting with the local AWS User Group for an open source special, before heading off to Vietnam (FOSSASIA, and the local CNCF chapter), Australia (Everything Open, and a couple of meetups), and then speaking at the AWS User Group in Thailand before heading home. If you are a regular reader of this newsletter and are in this region, check out the Events section below and maybe we can meet for coffee.</p>
<h3 id="latest-open-source-projects">Latest open source projects</h3>
<p><em>The great thing about open source projects is that you can review the source code. If you like the look of these projects, make sure you that take a look at the code, and if it is useful to you, get in touch with the maintainer to provide feedback, suggestions or even submit a contribution. The projects mentioned here do not represent any formal recommendation or endorsement, I am just sharing for greater awareness as I think they look useful and interesting!</em></p>
<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>
<p><strong>aws-rotate-key</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3sd">aws-rotate-key</a> is a project from AWS Community Builder  Stefan Sundin, that helps you implement security good practices around periodically regenerating your API keys. This command line tool simplifies the rotation of those access keys as defined in your local ~/.aws/credentials file. Check out the README for plenty of helpful info and examples of how you might use this.</p>
<p><strong>pristup</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3se">pristup</a> is along similar lines to the previous project, except this project from my colleague Dark Mesaros, provides a way to generate temporary AWS Console sign-in URLs. The purpose of this is to enable your users that do not have AWS Console access, temporary access to it without the need for a username and password. As with all of Darko&rsquo;s projects, excellent documentation and examples abound in the README.</p>
<p><strong>cfn-bedrock-notify</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3sc">cfn-bedrock-notify</a> is a new tool from my colleague Du&rsquo;an Lightfoot that is a very creative an interesting way to incorporate large language models to help you troubleshoot failed Cloudformation deployments. How many times have you had a deployment fail, only to reach out to your preferred search tool to help solve the problem. Well with this project deployed, any issues are sent via SNS to Amazon Bedrock using Anthropic Claude v3, and (hopefully) the answer to your problems are returned via the email of the SNS subscriber. Nice!</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/labeveryday-cloud-projects/cfn-bedrock-notify/blob/main/img/cfn-notify.png?raw=true" alt="architecture of cfh-bedrock-notify"></p>
<p><strong>chronos-forecasting</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3rh">chronos-forecasting</a> is a family of pre-trained time series forecasting models based on language model architectures. A time series is transformed into a sequence of tokens via scaling and quantisation, and a language model is trained on these tokens using the cross-entropy loss. Once trained, probabilistic forecasts are obtained by sampling multiple future trajectories given the historical context. Chronos models have been trained on a large corpus of publicly available time series data, as well as synthetic data generated using Gaussian processes. You can check the supporting blog post <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3ri">Adapting language model architectures for time series forecasting</a>, where Abdul Fatir Ansari and Lorenzo Stella provide some additional details.</p>

<p><strong>fm-leaderboarder</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3sf">fm-leaderboarder</a> provides resources to help you benchmark against the growing number of different models to help you find the best LLM for your own business use case based on your own tasks, prompts, and data.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/aws-samples/fm-leaderboarder/blob/main/resources/screenshot.jpg?raw=true" alt="example leaderboard"></p>
<p><strong>llm-colosseum</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/aws-banjo/llm-colosseum">llm-colosseum</a> is another repo that takes a more creative look at benchmarking your LLM&rsquo;s, this time using a classic video arcade fighting game. My colleague Banjo has put together this repo, together with a supporting blog post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3sl">14 LLMs fought 314 Street Fighter matches</a>. Here&rsquo;s who won, which is a must read this week. Check out the repo and post for videos of these LLMs playing games.</p>
<h3 id="demos-samples-solutions-and-workshops">Demos, Samples, Solutions and Workshops</h3>
<p><strong>newsletter-manager-template</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3sa">newsletter-manager-template</a> is a project from AWS Community Builder Matteo Depascale that provides backend service orchestrations for newsletter builders. Matteo has put together a blog post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3sb">Building a Serverless Newsletter: Your Guide to AWS and Amazon SES</a>, shares how you can use this project in order to build all the supporting infrastructure to manage your newsletters.</p>
<p><strong>aws-real-time-web-shop-analytics</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3sh">aws-real-time-web-shop-analytics</a> this project delivers a code sample to experiment with real-time web analytics with a simplified online shop as web front, Apache Flink application for real-time pattern detection using Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink, and an OpenSearch Dashboard to visualise the results using Amazon OpenSearch Service. This application is capable of ingesting click, add to cart, and purchase event from the online shop including the user that can be specified on the interface. Then the clickstream data is analysed for predefined patterns such as removing duplicates, add to cart events that are not followed by a purchase event within a specified timeframe etc. The results are then visualised in the OpenSearch Dashboard. This repository is intended to get developers started experimenting with analysing clickstream data on AWS.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-real-time-web-shop-analytics/blob/main/images/opensearch_dashboard.png?raw=true" alt="dashboard for aws real time shop analytics"></p>
<p><strong>aws-serverless-example-for-webxr</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3si">aws-serverless-example-for-webxr</a> This repository contains an example solution on how to enhance your WebXR applications using AWS Serverless Services, providing scalable, efficient, and seamless user experiences.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-serverless-example-for-webxr/blob/main/images/plugin-demo.gif?raw=true" alt="demo screenshot of webxr"></p>
<p><strong>video-understanding-solution</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3sj">video-understanding-solution</a> This is a deployable solution to help save your time in understanding videos without having to watch every video. You can upload videos and this solution can generate AI-powered summary and entities extraction for each video. It also supports Q&amp;A about the video like &ldquo;What is funny about the video?&rdquo;, &ldquo;How does Jeff Bezos look like there?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;What shirt did he wear?&rdquo;. You can also search for videos using semantic search e.g. &ldquo;Amazon&rsquo;s culture and history&rdquo;. This solution extracts information from visual scenes, audio, visible texts, and detected celebrities or faces in the video. It leverages an LLM which can understand visual and describe the video frames.</p>
<p>You can upload videos to your Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket bucket by using AWS console, CLI, SDK, or other means (e.g. via AWS Transfer Family). This solution will automatically trigger processes including call to Amazon Transcribe for voice transcription, call to Amazon Rekognition to extract the objects visible, and call to Amazon Bedrock with Claude 3 model to extract scenes and visually visible text. The LLM used can perform VQA (visual question answering) from images (video frames), which is used to extract the scene and text. This combined information is used to generate the summary and entities extraction as powered by generative AI with Amazon Bedrock. The UI chatbot also uses Amazon Bedrock for the Q&amp;A chatbot. The summaries, entities, and combined extracted information are stored in S3 bucket, available to be used for further custom analytics.</p>
<p>Check out the README for some great demo videos of this in action. Well worth exploring this demo.</p>

<h3 id="aws-and-community-blog-posts">AWS and Community blog posts</h3>
<p>Each week I spent a lot of time reading posts from across the AWS community on open source topics. In this section I share what personally caught my eye and interest, and  I hope that many of you will also find them interesting.</p>
<p><strong>The best from around the Community</strong></p>
<p>The community has been very busy producing open source content, and here are the pick of the posts I read over the past two weeks. This week we start with AWS Community Builder Dakota Lewallen who shares code and a blog post on how you can do multi-region deployments with AWS CDK in the post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3s0">Multi-region Deployments with CDK</a>. Not content with just one post, Dakota also managed to put out <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3s9">Three Tips for Writing CDK Tests</a> to help you get started with adding tests to your CDK stacks.Go check them both out. When it comes to getting started with a new technology, I love posts that provide me with everything I need, and more. AWS Community Builder Julia Furst Morgado does this for folks wanting to get started with deploying applications on Kubernetes, specifically Amazon EKS, in the post <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3s1">Setting Up a Kubernetes Cluster on AWS EKS With Eksctl and Deploying an App</a>. This one is worth reading.</p>
<p>From Kubernetes to Apache Kafka now, and a series of posts that start with AWS Community Builder Ehi Enabs, who provides a very handy reference post with sample code, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3s2">Deploying Amazon Managed Service for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) with CloudFormation</a>, that does what it says on the tin. Sticking with Apache Kafka, my colleague Ricardo Ferreira has put together a series of must read posts, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3s5">Apache Kafka Partitions as Unit of Durability</a>, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3s4">Apache Kafka Partitions as a Unit of Parallelism</a>, and <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3s3">Apache Kafka Partitions as Unit of Storage</a>. These are all solid gold, so make sure you read those. AWS Community Builder Priyankar Prasad joins in the Apache Kafka party with <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3s6">Amazon MSK with RedPanda-Console</a>, and provides sample code and this blog post that shows you how you can deploy <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3s7">RedPanda Console</a>, an open source project that is developer focused and helps you keep on top of your Apache Kafka clusters.</p>
<p>Finishing things this week is another post from Ehi Enabs, this time helping you to automate the provisioning of Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP) with his post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3s8">Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP) with CloudFormation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Apache Kafka</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka Connect (Amazon MSK Connect) now supports the ability to delete MSK Connect worker configurations, tag resources, and manage worker configurations and custom plugins using AWS CloudFormation. Amazon MSK Connect is a fully managed service for Apache Kafka Connect. With a few clicks, MSK Connect allows you to easily deploy connectors that move data between Apache Kafka and external systems. Together, these new capabilities make it easier for you to manage your MSK Connect resources and automate deployments through CI/CD pipelines.</p>
<p>When you deploy a connector on MSK Connect, you have to either use the default worker configuration or provide custom worker configuration. As you create and delete connectors, these configurations can grow in number and become difficult to manage. The new delete worker configuration API allows you to delete unused worker configurations to make resource management easier. With resource tagging, you can assign tags in the form of key-value pairs to MSK Connect connectors, custom plugins, or worker configurations. Tagging can help you with resource grouping, cost allocation and reporting, and access control with tag-based policies. Lastly, support for additional AWS CloudFormation resource types allows you to perform Create, Read, Update, Delete and List operations on custom plugins and worker configurations besides connectors.</p>
<p><strong>Apache Flink</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink makes it easier to transform and analyse streaming data in real time with Apache Flink. Apache Flink is an open source framework and engine for processing data streams. Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink reduces the complexity of building and managing Apache Flink applications and integrates with Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK), Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, Amazon OpenSearch Service, Amazon DynamoDB streams, Amazon S3, custom integrations, and more using built-in connectors.</p>
<p>Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink now supports Apache Flink 1.18. This new version includes improvements to connectors including Amazon OpenSearch, Amazon DynamoDB, MongoDB, and improved watermark alignment and query performance. For a complete list of supported features, improvements, and bug fixes please see Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3rg">in the documentation</a>. Also check out the supporting blog post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3rv">Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink now supports Apache Flink version 1.18</a> where  Lorenzo Nicora and Francisco Morillo discuss some of the interesting new features and capabilities of Apache Flink, introduced with the most recent major releases, 1.16, 1.17, and 1.18.</p>
<p>You can now upgrade existing applications to new Apache Flink versions in Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink using in-place Apache Flink version upgrades. With in-place Apache Flink version upgrades you retain application traceability across Apache Flink versions including snapshots, logs, metrics, tags, Flink configurations, resource limit increases, VPCs, and more. You can upgrade to new Apache Flink versions by selecting the application, the snapshot you want to restore from, and the new Apache Flink runtime you require using the AWS CLI, SDK, CloudFormation, or Management Console.</p>
