      <description>Welcome to issue #205 of the AWS open source newsletter, the newsletter where we try and provide you the best open source on AWS content. This will be the last edition of 2024, but looking forward to coming back in 2025 with more great open source project and content. As always, we have more great new projects to check out, which include a project that simplifies how you manage complex Kubernetes resource configurations, a library to accelerate open source analytics using Amazon S3, a look at a GraphRAG project, a project that helps NodeJS developers make it easier to make use of some advanced Amazon Aurora capabilities, an ESLinting tool for AWS CDK, and more.</description>

      <description>Feb 20th, 2023 - Instalment #145 Welcome to edition #145 of the AWS open source newsletter. I hope some of you were able to catch the new Build on Open Source show we live streamed last Friday. You can catch up and replay the session by clicking on this link, where we went over a number of projects from this and a few previous newsletters, and we had special guest Valter who walked us through his project terraform-dev-containers.</description>
