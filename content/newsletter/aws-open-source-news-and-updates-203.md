### Latest open source projects

*The great thing about open source projects is that you can review the source code. If you like the look of these projects, make sure you that take a look at the code, and if it is useful to you, get in touch with the maintainer to provide feedback, suggestions or even submit a contribution. The projects mentioned here do not represent any formal recommendation or endorsement, I am just sharing for greater awareness as I think they look useful and interesting!*

### Tools

**bedrock-litellm**

[bedrock-litellm](https://github.com/aws-samples/bedrock-litellm) is an awesome project that provides a way of proxying requests in the OpenAI format, so that they will work with Amazon Bedrock. OpenAI is often one of the default options for integrating various generative AI tools and libraries, and now you have a way of being able to point those to use foundational models managed by Amazon Bedrock. It uses [litellm](https://www.litellm.ai/) to do this, and is deployed in a Kubernetes cluster.

**aws-config-rule-rds-logging-enabled-remediation**

[aws-config-rule-rds-logging-enabled-remediation](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-config-rule-rds-logging-enabled-remediation) provides code that will help you checks if respective logs of Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) are enabled using AWS Config rule 'rds-logging-enabled'. The rule is NON_COMPLIANT if any log types are not enabled. AWS Systems Manager Automation document used as remediation action to enable the logs export to CloudWatch for the RDS instances that are marked NON_COMPLIANT.

**apeman**

[apeman](https://github.com/hotnops/apeman) is a new tool that helps security people to map and visualise AWS identity attack paths. The README provides detailed instructions on how to get up and running, but I also found the blog post, [ Project Apeman : A Comprehensive Guide To Graph-Based AWS Security Analysis](https://kalilinuxtutorials.com/project-apeman/) very helpful. Daniel Heinsen talks more about this in depth in his talk at SpecterOps.

**aws-mine**

[aws-mine](https://github.com/StevenSmiley/aws-mine) is a project from Steven Smiley that should interest security folk. It provides a [honey](https://uk.norton.com/blog/iot/what-is-a-honeypot) token system for AWS, that allows you to create AWS access keys that can be placed in various places to tempt bad guys. If used, you will be notified within ~4 minutes. You can then investigate that asset to determine if it may have been compromised. 

![demo of aws-mine running](https://github.com/StevenSmiley/aws-mine/blob/main/demo.gif?raw=true)

**bedrock-embed-web**

[bedrock-embed-web](https://github.com/tagazok/bedrock-embed-web) is a new project from my colleague Olivier Leplus that makes it easier than ever to embed Amazon Bedrock foundation models within a chat interface in your web applications.

**cdk-express-pipeline**

[cdk-express-pipeline](https://github.com/rehanvdm/cdk-express-pipeline) is the latest project from AWS Hero Rehan van der Merwe (who's project I use to track usage metrics of this newsletter!) which provides an alternative to those of you who want to use some of the features of AWS CDK Pipelines, but perhaps need it less opinionated. CDK Express Pipelines is a library built on the AWS CDK, allowing you to define pipelines in a CDK-native method. It leverages the CDK CLI to compute and deploy the correct dependency graph between Waves, Stages, and Stacks using the .addDependency method, making it build-system agnostic and an alternative to AWS CDK Pipelines. Check out the clear documentation which will help you get started in no time.

**improve-employee-productivity-using-genai**

[improve-employee-productivity-using-genai](https://github.com/aws-samples/improve-employee-productivity-using-genai) is an innovative code sample designed to elevate the efficiency and effectiveness of writing tasks through the integration of AI technologies. Tailored for AWS users, this assistant example utilises Amazon Bedrock and generative AI models to automate the creation of initial templates, that can also be customised for your own needs. Users can input both text and images, benefiting from the multimodal capabilities of cutting-edge AI like the Claude 3 family, which supports dynamic interaction with multiple data types. The README is very comprehensive and covers not only how to set up and configure this project, but also has lots of great short videos of it in action. Looks really cool, and a project for my weekend I think.

**streamlit-bedrock-claude-sample**

[streamlit-bedrock-claude-sample](https://github.com/garystafford/streamlit-bedrock-claude-sample) - I have featured Gary Stafford's open source projects and blog posts regularly in this newsletter. Gary has built a number of simple Streamlit applications to make it easy access the latest models and features of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amazon Bedrock as part of several talks, workshops, and demonstrations he has done.  As part these, he has put together a simple Streamlit application that uses the Amazon Bedrock boto3 Python SDK to call the latest Anthropic Claude 3 family of multimodal foundation models. The application accepts a system and user prompt and generates a text-based response. The Streamlit app can be easily modified to incorporate new Bedrock features or as a starting point for your own applications.

**aws-chatbot-fargate-python**

[aws-chatbot-fargate-python](https://github.com/ran-isenberg/aws-chatbot-fargate-python) is a new repo from AWS Hero Ran Isenberg that deploys a Streamlit Chatbot in an AWS Fargate-based ESC cluster web application using AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit). The infrastructure includes an ECS cluster, Fargate service, Application Load Balancer, VPC, and WAF and includes security best practices with CDK-nag verification. The chatbot is based on an implementation by Streamlit and the initial prompt is that the chatbot is me, Ran the builder, a serverless hero and attempts to answer as me. The Chatbot uses custom domain (you can remove it or change it to your own domain) and assume an OpenAI token exists in the account in the form of a secrets manager secret for making API calls to OpenAI.

**my-steampipe-arsenal**

[my-steampipe-arsenal](https://github.com/gabrielsoltz/my-steampipe-arsenal/blob/main/check-route53-inactive-alias.sql) Sometimes GitHub Gists or snippets are super useful, and Gabriel Soltz shares one such useful snippet in his repo of Steampipe queries that allows you to check for inactive Route53 alias'. Check out some of the other ones he shares too.

**What I am reading from around the Community**

Each week I spent a lot of time reading posts from across the AWS community on open source topics. In this section I share what personally caught my eye and interest, and I hope that many of you will also find them interesting. It was really tough though, as there were so many great posts.

Starting things off this week is Muhammed Salih Guler, who shares how to build and deploy a Flutter web application using AWS Amplify in his post, [Deploy a Flutter Web Application Using AWS Amplify](https://salihgueler.medium.com/deploy-a-flutter-web-application-using-aws-amplify-68a3e4399716). One of my colleagues (Derek Bingham) has put together a bunch of Flutter content, and I have been meaning to try this out. I am going to give this a try over the weekend, so will let you know how I get on (watch out via socials).  I have been writing and play with Valkey over the past few weeks (check out some of my blog posts on this topic) and so found Dan Touitou's deep dive, [Unlock 1 Million RPS: Experience Triple the Speed with Valkey](https://valkey.io/blog/unlock-one-million-rps/), super interesting. Valkey 8.0 is available for folks to play with, and hopefully will go GA soon. I always have time to read up on robotics and IoT, so Mike's latest post, [Simulating Robots in the Cloud with EC2 and O3DE](https://community.aws/content/2jzQUoDbiUu8kSazQUdips5ZB8J/simulating-robots-in-the-cloud-with-ec2-and-o3de), shows you how you can speed up your robotic development using simulators, in this instance the Open 3D Engine (O3DE) open source project. Go check it out.

Next up we have a series of great blog posts covering all things AWS CDK from Pahud Hsieh. From diving deep into how grantRead works in the post, [What happens when bucket.grantRead() in AWS CDK](https://community.aws/content/2k0yQqU4HqYwTYteEStNVMbRRfZ/what-happens-when-bucket-grantread-in-cdk), or how you can begin contributing to the AWS CDK project in [Contributing to AWS CDK](https://community.aws/content/2jhmIXdVWZJy3uJnUfEzEmp652j/contributing-to-aws-cdk), dive deeper into more advanced CDK topics such as a look at some real-world use cases to override L1 props from L2 constructs in [Customize CDK L1 construct props from L2](https://community.aws/content/2kF5w7Bmwpob9wgqFMGJED5KJus/customize-cdk-l1-construct-props-from-l2). Pahud has also embraced generative AI, and shows how using tools like Amazon Q Developer (not open source sadly), you can use it to both create your CDK applications in [Writing CDK like a Pro using Amazon Q Customizations](https://community.aws/content/2jiAuQ0WB9fTInbfjgK9yXZt9f6/writing-cdk-like-a-pro-using-amazon-q-customizations), or how to build L2 CDK Construct Methods in [Generate CDK Construct Methods Using Amazon Q Customizations](https://community.aws/content/2kFFk3zU2sJsKQfIXT8Hs9LDqDG/generate-cdk-construct-methods-using-amazon-q-customizations). It's not only Pahud that has been creating CDK content though, my colleague Abhishek Gupta has also been exploring this topic in his latest blogging adventure, [Use AWS Generative AI CDK constructs to speed up app development](https://itnext.io/use-aws-generative-ai-cdk-constructs-to-speed-up-app-development-e032f3bb7adf) where he explores how to use the AWS Generative AI Constructs Library to deploy a complete RAG application.

I guess that is a good segway into a series of posts covering the latest open source libraries and frameworks for generative AI.  First up is Michele Ricciardi who shares how to enable prompt versioning and management, using LangChain and Amazon Bedrock Prompt management in his post, [Integrate Amazon Bedrock Prompt Management in LangChain applications](https://community.aws/content/2kPiIOekxM5O0kTGr9U3rgw183H/integrate-amazon-bedrock-prompt-manager-in-langchain-applications). Next up is a post from John Wick (yup, there was no way I was NOT going to post this right!) who shares how to work with generative AI in Javascript in his post, [GenAI, from your Local machine to AWS with LangChain.js](https://community.aws/content/2kPmdxeIrfBJKiCQtvVO8WvHWIZ/genai-from-your-local-machine-to-aws-with-langchain-js).

We conclude this round up with some cloud native posts, starting with Marcelo Andrade who shares how to find out which Kubernetes Pod owns a specific container in his post [From which Kubernetes pod (and namespace!) is this process that I see on my host? ](https://dev.to/aws-builders/from-which-kubernetes-pod-and-namespace-is-this-process-that-i-see-on-my-host-5c0n). I love these kinds of posts as they cover the things that I always need to know at some point (so I have bookmarked this for future reference). AWS Community Builder Saifeddine Rajhi shares how to use and run Argo Workflows to orchestrate jobs within your Kubernetes environments in the post, [Data on Kubernetes: Part 4â€Š-â€ŠArgo Workflows: Simplify parallel jobs : Container-native workflow engine for Kubernetes](https://dev.to/aws-builders/data-on-kubernetes-part-4-argo-workflows-simplify-parallel-jobs-container-native-workflow-engine-for-kubernetes-1fi4). This is part of a series which I found myself scrolling through, so check those other posts out too. Finally, we have AWS Community Builder Sunny Bhambhani shares how to get multiple helm charts installed in your Kubernetes clusters in his post, [Installing multiple helm charts in one go using simple bash utility](https://community.aws/content/2jgJ4HxHXquEZHqn6MQIpE8Ls0b/installing-multiple-helm-charts-in-one-go-using-simple-bash-utility).

### Quick updates

**Karpenter**

Karpenterâ€™s APIs graduate out of beta with the release of Karpenter version 1.0.0. Karpenter is a flexible, efficient, and high-performance Kubernetes compute management solution that helps improve application availability, reduce operational overhead, and increase cluster compute utilisation. This release also includes three new features which provide customers greater control over how and when Karpenter disrupts Kubernetes applications. Customers can use Karpenter with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) or any conformant Kubernetes cluster. Like other Kubernetes open-source projects, Karpenterâ€™s APIs follow a maturity progression from alpha to beta then stable. In October 2023, the Karpenter project graduated its APIs from alpha to beta. This release marks the final milestone in the projectâ€™s maturity and customers can be assured that all Karpenter APIs will remain available in future 1.0 minor versions and not modified in any way that results in breaking changes. Alongside the graduation from beta, this 1.0 release includes three new features for Karpenter: 1/ the ability to specify disruption reasons, e.g. underutilisation, emptiness, drift, for disruption budgets, 2/ a forceful disruption mode that helps customers balance application availability against security requirements, and 3/ an expansion of consolidateAfter which lets customers better tune Karpenterâ€™s consolidation feature to meet their cost-efficiency and application availability requirements.

Alex Kestner, Robert Northard, and Rajdeep Saha share more details in the post, [Announcing Karpenter 1.0](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/announcing-karpenter-1-0/)

**MySQL**

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for MySQL now supports MySQL minor version 8.0.39. We recommend that you upgrade to the latest minor versions to fix known security vulnerabilities in prior versions of MySQL, and to benefit from the bug fixes, performance improvements, and new functionality added by the MySQL community. Learn more about the enhancements in RDS for MySQL 8.0.39 in the Amazon RDS user guide.

Amazon RDS for MySQL now supports version 8.4 in the Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment, allowing you to evaluate the latest Long-Term Support Release on Amazon RDS for MySQL. You can deploy MySQL 8.4 in the Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment that has the benefits of a fully managed database, making it simpler to set up, operate, and monitor databases. MySQL 8.4 is the latest Long-Term Support Release from the MySQL community.

**PostgreSQL**

There were a number of PostgreSQL related updates since the last newsletter. Here are the highlights:

Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition now supports PostgreSQL versions 16.3, 15.7, 14.12, 13.15, and 12.19. These releases contain product improvements and bug fixes made by the PostgreSQL community, along with Aurora-specific improvements. Databases now startup faster after upgrades and restarts. Version 16.3 with IO-Optimized configuration includes performance enhancements that improve write throughput for 8xl and larger instances. These releases also contain Babelfishâ€™s new features and improvements such as support for group AD, logical replication, Blue/Green Deployments, and LIKE operator for AI collations. As a reminder, Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL 12 support ends on Feb 29, 2025. Upgrade to a newer major version. You can initiate a minor version upgrade by modifying your DB cluster.

Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition now supports pgvector 0.7.0, an open-source extension for PostgreSQL for storing vector embeddings in your database. pgvector provides vector similarity search capabilities enabling Aurora usage for semantic search and retrieval-augemented generation (RAG) in generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications. pgvector 0.7.0 adds parallelism to improve the Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW) index build time in Aurora. pgvector 0.7.0 adds two new vector data types: halfvec for storing dimensions as 2-byte floats, and sparsevec for storing up to 1,000 nonzero dimensions, and now supports indexing binary vectors using the PostgreSQL-native bit type. These additions let you use scalar and binary quantization for the vector data type using PostgreSQL expression indexes, which reduces index storage size and lowers index build time. Quantization also lets you increase the maximum dimensions of vectors you can index: 4,000 for halfvec and 64,000 for binary vectors. pgvector 0.7.0 is available in Amazon Aurora clusters running PostgreSQL 16.3, 15.7, 14.12, 13.15, and 12.19 and higher in all applicable AWS Regions.

Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 17 Beta 3 is now available in the Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment, allowing you to evaluate the pre-release of PostgreSQL 17 on Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. You can deploy PostgreSQL 17 Beta 3 in the Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment that has the benefits of a fully managed database. PostgreSQL 17 includes updates to vacuuming that reduces memory usage, improves time to finish vacuuming, and shows progress of vacuuming indexes. With PostgreSQL 17, you no longer need to drop logical replication slots when performing a major version upgrade. PostgreSQL 17 continues to build on the SQL/JSON standard, adding support for `JSON_TABLE` features that can convert JSON to a standard PostgreSQL table. The `MERGE` command now supports the `RETURNING` clause, letting you further work with modified rows. PostgreSQL 17 also includes general improvements to query performance and adds more flexibility to partition management with the ability to SPLIT/MERGE partitions.

Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) for PostgreSQL now supports the latest minor versions 16.4, 15.8, 14.13, 13.16, and 12.20. This release of RDS for PostgreSQL also includes updates for PostgreSQL extensions such as pgvector 0.7.3, hypopg 1.4.1, and others.

**Amazon EMR**

Amazon EMR 7.2 release is now generally available and includes Apache Spark 3.5.1, Trino 436, and PrestoDB 0.285, Apache Iceberg 1.5.0 and Delta 3.1. Furthermore, with Amazon EMR 7.2, you can view additional Amazon CloudWatch metrics for enhanced monitoring in the Amazon EMR console, which provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities, allowing you to track the performance and health of your cluster more effectively. You can configure the Amazon CloudWatch Agent to publish metrics for Apache Hadoop, YARN, and Apache HBase applications running on your Amazon EMR on EC2 clusters, and track the metrics of each cluster within the EMR console. In addition, Amazon EMR 7.2 adds support for Apache Flink Operator 1.8 with Amazon EMR on EKS.

**ActiveMQ**

Amazon MQ now supports ActiveMQ minor version 5.18, which introduces several improvements and fixes compared to the previous version of ActiveMQ supported by Amazon MQ. These enhancements include initial support for the JMS 2.0 simplified APIs, such as JMSContext, JMSProducer, and JMSConsumer, as well as the implementation of methods for XA transactions. Starting from ActiveMQ 5.18, Amazon MQ will manage patch version upgrades for your brokers. All brokers on ActiveMQ version 5.18 will be automatically upgraded to the next compatible and secure patch version in your scheduled maintenance window. If you are utilising prior versions of ActiveMQ, such as 5.17, 5.16, or 5.15, we strongly recommend you to upgrade to ActiveMQ 5.18. You can easily perform this upgrade with just a few clicks in the AWS Management Console.

**Red Hat Enterprise Linux**

Amazon AppStream 2.0 now offers support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, enabling ISVs and central IT organisations to stream Red Hat Enterprise Linux apps and desktops to users while leveraging the flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of the AWS Cloud. With this launch, customers have the flexibility to choose from a broader set of operating systems including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Amazon Linux 2, and Microsoft Windows. This launch enables organisations operating in highly regulated industries to accelerate time to market, scale resources up or down with demand, and manage the entire fleet centrally through the AWS Console by streaming Red Hat Enterprise Linux apps from AppStream 2.0. Red Hat Enterprise Linux on AppStream 2.0 also enables traditional desktop apps to be converted to a SaaS delivery model without the cost of refactoring, while pay-as-you-go billing and license-included images ensure you only pay for the resources you use. Red Hat Enterprise Linux is currently supported in all AWS Regions where AppStream 2.0 is available. Red Hat Enterprise Linux-based instances use per second billing (with a minimum of 15 minutes).

**Cedar Policies: Default Deny and Avoiding Evaluation Errors with Validation**

A new video from Cedar Craft, a series of brilliant short videos that walk you through key concepts of Cedar and then shows you how these work with hands on code examples. In this latest video, they look at Policy errors. Policies that error can be difficult to reason about. We should a small example here where two seemingly equivalent policies give different answers if you make the "same" mistake in both. The fix is easy though: always validate your policies!
