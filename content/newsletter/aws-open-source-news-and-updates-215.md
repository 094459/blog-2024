##  Edition #215 - October 2025

Welcome to issue #215 of the AWS open source newsletter, the only newsletter that I know of that brings you the best open source on AWS content.  There is nothing spooky or scary in this months edition we have a nice selection of projects that cover a broad range of use cases - tools to help you with CloudFormation stacks, provide a GUI layer over your Amazon S3 buckets, terminal user interfaces to work with Amazon ECS and your AWS profiles, a couple of nice tools to simplify building agentic applications using Strands Agents, and more. We also have some really cool demos that include showing how you can move from monolith to modern application (including thinking about portability, building AI powered SLDC architectures, and a really neat use of the Nitro Enclaves feature of Nitro EC2 instances. Some great stuff this month.

The projects will keep you busy until next month for sure, but we also have plenty of reading material in this months newsletter. In this edition we have featured projects that include Valkey, Redis, AWS CDK, CDK Booster, Fluent Bit, Strands Agents SDK, LangChain, Streamlit, Argo CD, Slurm, KubeArmor, Red Hat OpenShift, ROSA, Apache Iceberg, MySQL, MariaDB, Apache Kafka, InfluxDB, OpenSearch, LocalStack, LibreOffice, Apache Flink, Amazon Corretto, OpenJDK, Apache Airflow, Apache Arrow, Apache DataFusion, Parquet, Apache Cassandra, Amazon Keyspaces, AWS SAM, Finch, Kubernetes, Amazon EKS, Amazon EKS Distro, eksctl, OpenTelemetry, AWS ParallelCluster, Amazon Linux, and Smithy . That should keep you all very busy!

### Latest open source projects

*The great thing about open source projects is that you can review the source code. If you like the look of these projects, make sure you that take a look at the code, and if it is useful to you, get in touch with the maintainer to provide feedback, suggestions or even submit a contribution. The projects mentioned here do not represent any formal recommendation or endorsement, I am just sharing for greater awareness as I think they look useful and interesting!*

### Tools

**nicebucket**

[nicebucket](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/4kf) if you are looking for a GUI to manage your Amazon S3 buckets, then this project is for you. Some of the features include the ability to browse any S3-compatible bucket (S3, R2, etc.) like local folders, upload files individually, download files individually, create and delete folders, move files between folders, and preview files without downloading. The tool provides secure credential management using your system's keyring. Check out the README for some video demos of this tool and what it looks like.

**delstack**

[delstack](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/4kg) is a pretty handy tool for those situations (and we have ALL been there) when we get stuck waiting for CloudFormation stacks to delete. This open source tool from **AWS Hero Kenta Goto** helps you to force delete the entire AWS CloudFormation stack, even if it contains resources that fail to delete by the CloudFormation delete operation. Check out the README for a demo video and lots of details on how to configure this tool.

**tokenex**

[tokenex](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/4kh) this library provides a unified interface for obtaining and refreshing credentials from various cloud providers and authentication systems. It is designed to facilitate secure access to cloud resources by exchanging identity tokens for temporary credentials. **Toader Sebastian** has put together a supporting blog post that explains why they built this, so if this library sounds interesting to, go check it out - [Introducing tokenex: an open source Go library for fetching and refreshing cloud credentials](https://riptides.io/blog-post/introducing-tokenex-an-open-source-go-library-for-fetching-and-refreshing-cloud-credentials)

**ecs-voyager**

[ecs-voyager ](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/4ki) **AWS Community Builder Benjamen Pyle** has created an open source terminal user interface (TUI) for exploring and managing AWS ECS resources, inspired by k9s for Kubernetes (and built in Rust). Check out the README for detailed instructions on how to use this tool, and go on a voyage of your own!

**anywhere-mesh**

[anywhere-mesh](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/4kj)  is a Rust based ingress and client pair that lets ECS Anywhere tasks register themselves over WebSockets and receive HTTP traffic tunnelling from an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB). The repository also ships sample services, k6 scenarios, and infrastructure automation used to validate the mesh. **Kevin Truckenmiller** shared the reasons for creating this tool on the aws subreddit which you can [read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/1ny5nlq/built_a_lightweight_rustbased_mesh_for_ecs/).

> Most service meshes (Istio, Consul, etc.) are awesome but heavy if you just need routing and connectivity between environments. I wanted something that:
> Works natively with AWS ECS Anywhere
> Doesn’t require Kubernetes or control planes
> Uses WebSockets for persistent cloud to edge routing
> Handles host-based routing, health checks, and optional IAM validation
>
> It’s just a single binary (mesh) that runs as an ingress or client. Right now I’m gathering feedback because I like it, but wonder if anyone else has a purpose for it.

Kevin is looking for feedback, so if this tool sounds useful give it a go and let Kevin know what you think.

**awsui**

[awsui](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/4kk)  **junminhong (jasper)** has created a modern text based UI (TUI) for AWS that enables fast profile switching, seamless SSO re-auth, Amazon Q integration, smart CLI autocomplete, and bilingual UI.

**Community**

Each month I spend time reading posts from across the AWS community on open source topics. In this section I share what personally caught my eye and interest, and I hope that many of you will also find them interesting. x

Starting us off this month is **Khawaja Shams** who looks at the latest Valkey 8.1 release that introduces optimisations that promises lower memory usage and higher throughput, and goes on to demonstrate this by showing what happens when you insert 50 million members into a sorted set,  benchmarking this against Valkey 8.0. No spoilers you will have to read the post, [How Valkey 8.1 Handles 50 Million Sorted Set Inserts](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/4kc). Sticking with Valkey we have **Ran Shidlansik** who shared [Introducing Hash Field Expirations with us](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/4kd) that explains how Valkey's new hash field expirations feature allows developers to set different expiration times for individual fields within a hash, providing more flexibility in managing data lifetimes without increasing the complexity of the system or impacting performance. The final Valkey related post comes from **Yunus** who shares nice cost and performance analysis between Redis and Valkey in his post, [AWS Elasticache: A Performance and Cost Analysis of Redis 7.1 vs. Valkey 7.2](https://builder.aws.com/content/33pPyndP8eIcjWJprmCQaRiDf70/aws-elasticache-a-performance-and-cost-analysis-of-redis-71-vs-valkey-72?trk=fd6bb27a-13b0-4286-8269-c7b1cfaa29f0&sc_channel=el).

He goes on to dive deep into these, looking at use cases and comparing each approach. Go check it out if you use AWS CDK. **AWS Community Builder Marko Štrukelj** (ServerlessLife) gives you more CDK goodness in the shape of his post on LinkedIn, [CDK Booster - Speeding Up Bundling of Lambda Handlers](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cdk-booster-speeding-up-bundling-lambda-handlers-serverlesslife--q3gde) an [open source project](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/4ke) he created to speed up how CDK bundles TypeScript/JavaScript Lambda handlers, from sequential to all at once. Better still, its a drop in replacement, with just a tweak to your cdk.json. Defo something you should check out.

Next up is **haruki** who dives into the announcement this month of Fluent Bit 4.1.0 now being available within AWS for Fluent Bit 3.0.0 in his post, [AWS for Fluent Bit 3.0.0 Based on Fluent Bit 4.1.0](https://builder.aws.com/content/34DFtGMJZqLcbMv8erBliaMYa76/aws-for-fluent-bit-300-based-on-fluent-bit-410?trk=fd6bb27a-13b0-4286-8269-c7b1cfaa29f0&sc_channel=el). The post explores native OTLP support, faster JSON parsing, and enhanced security controls on Amazon Linux 2023 that eliminate the need for additional sidecar containers in your ECS and EKS environments.

To finish up this month we have my colleague **Elizabeth Fuentes** who has put together a really nice resource for speakers who regularly do talks at events and need to share resources with attendees. Check out [Building an Event Resources Website with AWS CDK and Amazon Q Developer CLI](https://builder.aws.com/content/347AT8mTyDtAQFkPxOEdjZjIvCU/building-an-event-resources-website-with-aws-cdk-and-amazon-q-developer-cli?trk=fd6bb27a-13b0-4286-8269-c7b1cfaa29f0&sc_channel=el) for details on what this looks like, and Eli shares a code repo so you can quickly get started.

**Apache Airflow**

Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) is a managed service for Apache Airflow that enables seamless workflow orchestration using the familiar Apache Airflow platform. It now supports Apache Airflow version 3.0, the latest major release of the workflow orchestration platform. This release enhances your ability to author, schedule, and monitor complex workflows with greater efficiency and control.

The availability of Apache Airflow v3.0 on MWAA introduces substantial improvements to workflow orchestration, including a completely redesigned interface for enhanced usability and advanced event-driven scheduling capabilities. This new scheduling system triggers workflows based on external events directly, eliminating the need for separate asset update pipelines. The newly introduced Task SDK in Apache Airflow v3.0 on MWAA help you simplify DAGs by reducing boilerplate code, making workflows more concise, readable, and consistent. Security and isolation are strengthened through the Task Execution API, which restricts direct access to the metadatabase and manages all runtime interactions. This release also features scheduler-managed backfill functionality, providing you better control over historical data processing. Additionally, MWAA now supports Python 3.12, while incorporating critical security improvements and bug fixes that enhance the overall reliability and security of your workflows in Amazon MWAA environments.

**InfluxDB**

Amazon Timestream for InfluxDB now offers support for InfluxDB 3. Now application developers and DevOps teams can run InfluxDB 3 databases as a managed service. InfluxDB 3 uses a new architecture for the InfluxDB database engine, built on Apache Arrow for in-memory data processing, Apache DataFusion for query execution, and columnar Parquet storage format with data persistence in Amazon S3 to deliver fast performance for high-cardinality data and large scale data processing for large analytical workloads.

With Amazon Timestream for InfluxDB 3, customers can leverage improved query performance and resource utilisation for data-intensive use cases while benefiting from virtually unlimited storage capacity through S3-based object storage. The service is available in two editions: Core, the open source version of InfluxDB 3, for near real-time workloads focused on recent data, and Enterprise for production workloads requiring high availability, multi-node deployments, and essential compaction capabilities for long-term storage. The Enterprise edition supports multi-node cluster configurations with up to 3 nodes initially, providing enhanced availability, improved performance for concurrent queries, and greater system resilience.

**Apache Kafka**

Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) now supports Apache Kafka version 4.1, introducing Queues as a preview feature, a new Streams Rebalance Protocol in early access, and Eligible Leader Replicas (ELR). Along with these features, Apache Kafka version 4.1 includes various bug fixes and improvements. For more details, please refer to the Apache Kafka release notes for version 4.1. A key highlight of Kafka 4.1 is the introduction of Queues as a preview feature. Customers can use multiple consumers to process messages from the same topic partitions, improving parallelism and throughput for workloads that need point-to-point message delivery. The new Streams Rebalance Protocol builds upon Kafka 4.0's consumer rebalance protocol, extending broker coordination capabilities to Kafka Streams for optimixed task assignments and rebalancing. Additionally, ELR is now enabled by default to strengthen availability. To start using Apache Kafka 4.1 on Amazon MSK, simply select version 4.1.x when creating a new cluster via the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. You can also upgrade existing MSK provisioned clusters with an in-place rolling update. Amazon MSK orchestrates broker restarts to maintain availability and protect your data during the upgrade. 

**Apache Cassandra**

Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) is a scalable, highly available, and managed Apache Cassandra–compatible database service. Amazon Keyspaces is serverless, so you pay for only the resources that you use and you can build applications that serve thousands of requests per second with virtually unlimited throughput and storage. It now supports Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) through new dual-stack endpoints that enable both IPv6 and IPv4 connectivity. This enhancement provides customers with a vastly expanded address space while maintaining compatibility with existing IPv4-based applications. The dual-stack endpoints functionality allows you to gradually transition your applications from IPv4 to IPv6 without disruption, enabling safer migration paths for your critical database services. IPv6 support is also available through PrivateLink interface Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) endpoints, allowing you to access Amazon Keyspaces privately without traversing the public internet.

**AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)**

AWS Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (SAM CLI) now supports Finch as an alternative to Docker for local development and testing of serverless applications. This gives developers greater flexibility in choosing their preferred local development environment when working with SAM CLI to build and test their serverless applications.

Developers building serverless applications spend significant time in their local development environments. SAM CLI is a command-line tool for local development and testing of serverless applications. It allows you to build, test, debug, and package your serverless applications locally before deploying to AWS Cloud. To provide the local development and testing environment for your applications, SAM CLI uses a tool that can run containers on your local device. Previously, SAM CLI only supported Docker as the tool for running containers locally. Starting today, SAM CLI also supports Finch as a container development tool. Finch is an open-source tool, developed and supported by AWS, for local container development. This means you can now choose between Docker and Finch as your preferred container tool for local development when working with SAM CLI.

You can use SAM CLI to invoke Lambda functions locally, test API endpoints, and debug your serverless applications with the same experience you would have in the AWS Cloud. With Finch support, SAM CLI now automatically detects and uses Finch as the container development tool when Docker is not available. You can also set Finch as your preferred container tool for SAM CLI. This new feature supports all core SAM CLI commands including sam build, sam local invoke, sam local start-api, and sam local start-lambda.

**Kubernetes**

Kubernetes version 1.34 introduced several new features and bug fixes, and AWS is excited to announce that you can now use Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and Amazon EKS Distro to run Kubernetes version 1.34. Starting today, you can create new EKS clusters using version 1.34 and upgrade existing clusters to version 1.34 using the EKS console, the eksctl command line interface, or through an infrastructure-as-code tool. Kubernetes version 1.34 introduces several key improvements, including projected service account tokens for kubelet image credential providers helping improve security for container image pulls, and Pod-level resource requests and limits for simplified multi-container resource management. The release also introduces Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) prioritised alternatives, enabling workloads to define prioritised device requirements for improved resource scheduling. To learn more about the changes in Kubernetes version 1.34, see our documentation and the Kubernetes project release notes. EKS now supports Kubernetes version 1.34 in all the AWS Regions where EKS is available, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

**Fluent Bit**

AWS for Fluent Bit enables Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS customers to collect, process, and route container logs to destinations including Amazon CloudWatch Logs, Amazon Data Firehose, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, and Amazon S3 without changing application code. AWS for Fluent Bit announced version 3.0.0, based on Fluent Bit version 4.1.0 and Amazon Linux 2023. Container logging using AWS for Fluent Bit is now more performant and more feature-rich for AWS customers, including those using Amazon Elastic Container Services (Amazon ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS).

AWS for Fluent Bit 3.0.0 upgrades the Fluent Bit version to 4.1.0, and upgrades the base image to Amazon Linux 2023. These updates deliver access to the latest Fluent Bit features, significant performance improvements, and enhanced security. New features include native OpenTelemetry (OTel) support for ingesting and forwarding OTLP logs, metrics, and traces with AWS SigV4 authentication—eliminating the need for additional sidecars. Performance improvements include faster JSON parsing, processing more logs per vCPU with lower latency. Security enhancements include TLS min version and cipher controls, which enforce your TLS policy on outputs from AWS for Fluent Bit for stronger protocol posture.

You can use AWS for Fluent Bit 3.0.0 on both ECS and EKS. On ECS, update the FireLens log-router container image in your task definition to the 3.0.0 tag from the Amazon ECR Public Gallery. On EKS, upgrade by either updating the Helm release or setting the DaemonSet image to the 3.0.0 version.

**AWS ParallelCluster**

AWS ParallelCluster is a fully-supported and maintained open-source cluster management tool that enables R&D customers and their IT administrators to operate high-performance computing (HPC) clusters on AWS. ParallelCluster is designed to automatically and securely provision cloud resources into elastically-scaling HPC clusters capable of running scientific and engineering workloads at scale on AWS. AWS ParallelCluster 3.14 is now generally available. This release includes P6e-GB200 and P6-B200 instance types, prioritised allocation strategies for optimised instance placement, and NICE DCV support for Amazon Linux 2023. Other features included in this release are support for chef-client log visibility in instance console inside the instance's system log and Amazon Linux 2023 with kernel 6.12.
