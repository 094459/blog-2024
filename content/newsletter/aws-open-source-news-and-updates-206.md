##  Edition #206

Happy New Year and welcome to issue #206 of the AWS open source newsletter, the newsletter where we try and provide you the best open source on AWS content.  As this is the first edition post re:Invent, you will find a lot of content showcasing all the new open source stuff that AWS has released, so there is plenty of really cool stuff to get stuck into - whether you are cloud native and want to know more about Amazon EKS Auto Mode, or more a data guru that is super excited about Apache Iceberg support in Amazon S3 Tables.

As always, we start with a selection of new open source projects from around AWS and the Community. It is safe to say that you have all been very busy over the last few weeks. This editions projects have something for everyone, including CDK constructs to help you simplify building your own BlueSky Personal Data Server and VSCode servers, Cedar on Kubernetes, planning tools for your ECS workloads, and a bunch of generative AI tools of course.

You can also catch up on the latest open source content as we feature projects including AWS CDK, Cedar, Swift, Apache Iceberg, Valkey, Kubernetes, Karpenter, OpenShift, Bottlerocket, TensorFlow, Triton, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, InfluxDB, Apache Kafka, Amazon EMR, Apache Spark, dbt, OpenZFS, AWS Amplify, Grafana, OpenSearch, Apache ActiveMQ, Powertools for AWS Lambda, Backstage, Apache Flink, and Prometheus. That lot should keep you very busy.

If you are coming to FOSDEM this weekend then get in touch. I will be manning the open source data analytics devroom with my fellow open source nerds Javier and Jaromir. Look forward to seeing some of you I hope!

As always, get in touch if you want me to feature your projects in this open source newsletter. Until the next time, I will leave you to dive into the good stuff!

### Latest open source projects

*The great thing about open source projects is that you can review the source code. If you like the look of these projects, make sure you that take a look at the code, and if it is useful to you, get in touch with the maintainer to provide feedback, suggestions or even submit a contribution. The projects mentioned here do not represent any formal recommendation or endorsement, I am just sharing for greater awareness as I think they look useful and interesting!*

### AWS and Community blog posts

**This weeks essential reading**

Here are the posts that I think are essential reads, so start here.

* [AWS CDK is splitting Construct Library and CLI](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/46b) - starting February 2025, the CDK CLI and the CDK Construct Library will no longer be released in lockstep and they will both have their own independent release cadence, meaning their version numbers are going to diverge - check out the post for additional details and the thinking behind this
* [Shaping the future of CDK together](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/46c) - in more CDK news, make sure you check out this announcement around a new Contributor Council for CDK that is being formed - check the post but also see the video below, which was a recording of the first meeting
* [New Amazon S3 Tables: Storage optimized for analytics workloads](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/46d) - provides everything you need to know about the re:Invent launch of Amazon S3 Tables, a new storage option optimised for tabular data using the Apache Iceberg format

**Community round up**

Each week I spent a lot of time reading posts from across the AWS community on open source topics. In this section I share what personally caught my eye and interest, and I hope that many of you will also find them interesting.

AWS Community Builder David Krohn starts us off with his post on unit and integration testing when using CDK, and specifically details around what the key differences are and when you might want to consider one versus the other. Read on in the post, [Enhancing Your AWS CDK Projects with Testing](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/477). AWS Commuity Builder Matsuda follows up with more AWS CDK content in the post, [ElastiCache Serverless: L2 CDK Construct Released in open-constructs](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/478), outlining the work done on an L2 Construct for ElastiCache Serverless which you can find on open-constructs, making it easy to automate your Valkey deployments. Sticking with Valkey we have Asaf Porat Stoler and Adar Guma Ovadya who put together [Reducing application latency and lowering Cloud bill by setting up your client library](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/479), that dives into Availability Zone (AZ) affinity routing mechanics, showing how it optimises your application's performance and cost using Valkey GLIDE (General Language Independent Driver for the Enterprise). The post also guides you (or should that be glides you....argh sorry!) through how to configure GLIDE to benefit from other key features. Very cool indeed.

Next up we have the Data on EKS team who have put together another great recipe that shows you how you can use the newly launched Amazon S3 Tables with Amazon EKS in the post, [S3 Tables with EKS](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/47a). If you have not seen these before they are great, so make sure you check the other recipes out too. Sticking with Kubernetes and data we have AWS Community Builder James Maina who writes, [Getting started on MOCO, the MySQL Operator for Kubernetes Part 1](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/47b) a robust, cloud-native solution designed to simplify the management of MySQL clusters in Kubernetes environments. This is the first time I have heard about this, so need to give it a try. Sticking with cloud native, we have AWS Community Builder Daniel Megyesi who shares a great post about some gotchas that you should be aware of when using Karpenter and assumptions around resources being scaled down in his post, [My PodDisruptionBudget bible to use with Karpenter and friends](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/47d) - defo worth a read that one. One of the launches at re:Invent I was most excited about was the Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes, so I was super happy to read [Leverage On-Premises Infrastructure in Amazon EKS Clusters with Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/47e), from AWS Community Builder Ahmed Salem who provides a quick post with how to set this up. 

Finally, we have AWS Community Builder Johannes Konings who shares how you can spin up VSCode on EC2 in the post, [Run vs code on a private AWS ec2 instance without ssh (with AWS CDK examples)](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/47c). I do this myself, so will give this code a go as my current solution uses CloudFormation which is great, but I love CDK so this feels like a no brainer to me.

### Quick updates

**PostgreSQL**

Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition now supports PostgreSQL versions 16.6, 15.10, 14.15, 13.18, and 12.22. Please note, this release supports the versions released by the PostgreSQL community on November 21,2024 and not the previous November 14,2024 release. These releases contain product improvements and bug fixes made by the PostgreSQL community, along with Aurora-specific security and feature improvements such as improved read replica upgrades for reduced downtime, new features for Babelfish and improved Global Database cross-region resiliency for better read availability during unplanned events.

As a reminder, Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL 12 standard support ends on Feb 28, 2025. You can either upgrade to a newer major version or continue to run Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL 12 past the end of standard support date with RDS Extended Support.

**MariaDB**

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for MariaDB now supports MariaDB minor versions 11.4.4, 10.11.10, 10.6.20, and 10.5.27. We recommend that you upgrade to the latest minor versions to fix known security vulnerabilities in prior versions of MariaDB, and to benefit from the bug fixes, performance improvements, and new functionality added by the MariaDB community. You can leverage automatic minor version upgrades to automatically upgrade your databases to more recent minor versions during scheduled maintenance windows. You can also leverage Amazon RDS Managed Blue/Green deployments for safer, simpler, and faster updates to your MariaDB instances.

If you are looking for newer releases, Amazon RDS for MariaDB now supports MariaDB Innovation Release 11.7 in the Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment, allowing you to evaluate the latest Innovation Release on Amazon RDS for MariaDB. You can deploy MariaDB 11.7 in the Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment that has the benefits of a fully managed database, making it simpler to set up, operate, and monitor databases. MariaDB 11.7 is the latest Innovation Release from the MariaDB community, and includes support for vector datatype, indexing, and search capabilities. MariaDB Innovation releases are supported by the community until the next Innovation release, whereas MariaDB Long Term Maintenance Releases, such as MariaDB 10.11 and MariaDB 11.4, are supported by the community for up to five years. Please refer to the MariaDB 11.7 release notes for more details about this release.

The Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment supports both Single-AZ and Multi-AZ deployments on the latest generation of instance classes. Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment database instances are retained for a maximum period of 60 days and are automatically deleted after the retention period. Amazon RDS database snapshots that are created in the preview environment can only be used to create or restore database instances within the preview environment.

**Apache Kafka**

Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka Connect (Amazon MSK Connect) now supports Apache Kafka Connect version 3.7 for new connectors. Apache Kafka Connect version 3.7 includes several bug fixes and performance improvements. For more details and a complete list of improvements and bug fixes, see the Apache Kafka release notes for version 3.7.

In more news, Amazon MSK Connect now supports updating connector configuration of existing connectors. With this launch, you can change the configuration of your connector using a single, UpdateConnector API call. You can make changes to your connector settings, such as updating source or sink destinations, or processing configurations. Amazon MSK Connect allows you to deploy and operate Apache Kafka Connect connectors in a fully managed environment. You can modify the connector configuration parameters of your existing connector when you have changes in your source or sink settings such as source database tables or topics to deliver to S3 bucket. You can update the connector configuration using the Amazon MSK Console, AWS CLI, SDK, or CloudFormation. After you update the connector, you can also check the update operation status in the MSK console or using API.

**Kubernetes**

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) now lets you programmatically access availability of Kubernetes versions. This simplifies how you can discover and select available versions before creating or upgrading clusters.

Kubernetes evolves rapidly, introducing three minor version releases each year with new features, design updates, and bug fixes. EKS provides standard support for each minor version for 14 months after release. After standard support ends, the version enters a 12-month extended support period. EKS stops supporting Kubernetes versions 26 months after their release. With this launch, you can now programmatically retrieve Kubernetes version metadata, including support status and dates. You can also discover the EKS platform version and default Kubernetes version EKS will use when creating new clusters.

There are of course hundreds of other amazing talks and tracks, so if you can, make sure you put this on your diary.
