Ok, time for today's tip....

### Tip 13 - Guiding Amazon Q : Generating perfect functions

In the previous tip I shared the different ways and techniques for generating code from function names, comments, and prompts. Once you have created code within the file you are editing, Amazon Q Developer retains this in context. You can use this to help simplify future code blocks and functions you can create.

As you create your first block of code or function, take time to make sure this is defined in as much detail as you need. Add documentation to your function (using the in-line prompt to quickly add documentation as per the previous tip), ensure you have the appropriate level of error handling, and any other things you need to add. Once you are happy with the FIRST code block or function, you are done.

When you now go to create further code blocks and functions, Amazon Q Developer will use this first code as a template, carrying on over the same level of detail as you added - documentation, error handling, etc. This will save you a LOT of time and typing, as well as provide better and more consistency in your code. I call this creating "perfect functions" - not in that they are coded perfectly, but in that they provide a blueprint for you to autogenerate more code within the file you are editing.

Check out this short video of this in action.
