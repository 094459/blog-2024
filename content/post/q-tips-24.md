### Tip 24 - Amazon Q Developer Resources : Community resources

There are some great resources to help you keep up with the latest tips, tricks, and good practices when using AI coding assistants like Amazon Q Developer. I have learned so much from these, so I thought I would share them here incase these are new to you.

* [promptz.dev](https://www.promptz.dev/) - this tool created by AWS Community Builder Christian Bonzelet provides an essential place to store and find prompts that you can use across different Amazon Q Developer tools and use cases

* [Amazon Q Developer Community resources](https://github.com/cremich/awesome-q-developer) - is a curated list of essential resources for every user of Amazon Q Developer

* Hands on content - there are a number of [hands on labs](https://github.com/094459/porto-techhub-amazon-q-workshop/tree/main) and walk throughs that you can follow along with. You can follow along Amazon Q Developer workshops like [this on](https://catalog.workshops.aws/q-developer/en-US) or [this on](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/e2226eb6-f109-47ae-b2c5-f02bf73b7d0e/en-US/10-introduction).

* [community.aws](https://community.aws/amazon-q) - we have a dedicated space on community.aws where developers both within AWS and the Community share blog posts on use cases, hints and tips, and more

* Amazon Q Developer plugin - you can view all the latest updates, including new features, bug fixes, and changes by review the [release notes](https://github.com/aws/aws-toolkit-vscode/releases) for the IDE plugin

If I have missed any resources that you use and find invaluable, please let me know so I can update this list.
