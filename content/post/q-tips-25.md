Hopefully these tips will help you accelerate your understanding and use of Amazon Q Developer. Remember that regular use will generate muscle memory in effective use of these tools.  They might not be suitable for everything we do as developers, when they are a very powerful tool when used appropriately.

> **Moving fast!** One thing to remember is that these tips are a moment in time, in an area that is moving super fast. I will review and update these as things change.

**Amazon Q Developer IDE cheat-sheet**

Massimo Re Ferre has put together the ultimate Amazon Q Developer cheat sheet which you can access [here](https://it20.info/misc/html-pages/amazon-q-ide-table.html). It provides a useful overview of all the Amazon Q Developer tools together with information such as context availability, supported languages, links to documentation and more. 

**Beyond development**

In this series of tips I have explored just the Amazon Q Developer from within the IDE. Amazon Q Developer provides developers much more capability beyond the editor. You can use it within the command line, from within the AWS console, within specific AWS services, and more.

Amazon Q Developer is not just for Christmas - its a new way of working. I hope that these tips have been useful and that they inspire some of you to try it out over the festive period.
