### Tip 9 - Guiding Amazon Q : Using import statements to direct suggestions

In the previous Amazon Q Developer tip I shared some of the ways that the Amazon Q Developer AI coding assistant uses context as consideration when generating its output and coding suggestions.

One of the ways that Amazon Q Developer understands context is by reviewing the current open file's import statements. If you are starting a new file, you can influence and guide Amazon Q Developer by ensuring that you add any relevant library imports before you prompt.

Check out this short video that shows this in action. When I provide an initial prompt to Amazon Q Developer with no additional context (just the prompt) I get one result. When I add a single line to add library imports into a new file and try again, you can see that Amazon Q Developer has picked this up and provides me with a completely different code suggestions.

That's it for today's tip. Let me know how you get on with this tip, and if you have your own drop me a message or reply. I would love to feature them here.
